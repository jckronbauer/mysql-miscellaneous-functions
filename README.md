# MySQL Miscellaneous Functions

This is a repository where I put MySQL functions that I needed to create at my workplace and I thought someone else could use it too.

## Installation

There's no need to install it. Simply import the desired SQL file(s) at your MySQL database(s).

## Usage

After importing SQL file(s), just invoke the new functions in your MySQL database(s).
